# Overview

This Project is a basic Angular App. Here, i deleted all the files in the _src_ folder and recreate them on my own to learn the **Architecture** of the Angular Project from scratch. So you will see a very basic app with no styling and order, and also i create two components.

## CoreAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## NOTE:

This is a testing App and you don't see anything on this app.
